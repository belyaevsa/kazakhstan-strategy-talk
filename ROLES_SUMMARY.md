## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### New Tables

**`profile_roles`**
```sql
- id (guid, primary key)
- profile_id (guid, foreign key to profiles)
- role (enum: Viewer, Editor, Admin)
- assigned_at (timestamp)
- Unique index on (profile_id, role)
```

### Modified Tables

**`profiles`**
- Added: `is_blocked` (boolean, default false)

**`comments`**
- Added: `is_deleted` (boolean, default false)
- Added: `deleted_at` (timestamp, nullable)

```

## üîë Authorization Policies

Configured in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
EditorPolicy  - Requires Editor OR Admin role
AdminPolicy   - Requires Admin role
ViewerPolicy  - Requires Viewer, Editor, OR Admin role
```

## üìã JWT Token Structure

Tokens now include role claims:

```json
{
  "nameid": "user-guid",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "unique_name": "username",
  "role": ["Viewer", "Editor"],  // Multiple roles possible
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

## üé® Frontend Changes

### Auth Service Methods

```typescript
authService.isAuthenticated() // Has valid token
authService.hasRole(role)     // Has specific role
authService.isViewer()        // Has Viewer role
authService.isEditor()        // Has Editor OR Admin
authService.isAdmin()         // Has Admin role
```

### UI Updates

**DocumentPage**:
- Edit button only visible for Editors/Admins
- "Sign in to Edit" shown for non-editors

**Future - Admin Panel**:
- User management interface
- Role assignment
- User blocking
- Comment moderation

## üöÄ Migration Steps

### 1. Update Database

```bash
cd api
dotnet ef migrations add AddRolesAndSoftDelete
dotnet ef database update
```

### 2. Existing Users

All existing users in the database will need the Viewer role assigned manually:

```sql
-- Add Viewer role to all existing users
INSERT INTO profile_roles (id, profile_id, role, assigned_at)
SELECT gen_random_uuid(), id, 0, NOW()
FROM profiles
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT profile_id FROM profile_roles);
```

### 3. Create First Admin

```sql
-- Assign Admin role to a specific user (replace with actual user ID)
INSERT INTO profile_roles (id, profile_id, role, assigned_at)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'user-guid-here', 2, NOW());
```

## üîí Security Features

### Blocked Users
- Cannot login (rejected at login endpoint)
- Existing tokens become invalid on next API call
- Comments remain visible but user cannot add new ones

### Soft Delete Comments
- Comments marked `is_deleted = true`
- Kept in database for audit trail
- Not returned in API responses
- Comment counts updated appropriately

### Role Validation
- Minimum one role per user (Viewer cannot be removed if only role)
- Role changes require Admin privileges
- Invalid roles rejected

## üìä Default Behavior

1. **New Registration**: User gets Viewer role automatically
2. **Login**: Blocked users are rejected
3. **Comments**: Deleted comments are hidden but preserved
4. **Authorization**: Fails gracefully with 403 Forbidden

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Register new user ‚Üí gets Viewer role
- [ ] Viewer can comment and vote
- [ ] Viewer cannot see Edit button
- [ ] Editor can modify pages/paragraphs
- [ ] Admin can block users
- [ ] Admin can delete comments (soft delete)
- [ ] Admin can assign/remove roles
- [ ] Blocked user cannot login
- [ ] Deleted comments are hidden
- [ ] JWT includes all user roles

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Create Admin Panel UI** (pending)
   - User list with roles
   - Role assignment interface
   - Block/unblock buttons
   - Comment moderation

2. **Add Page Visibility** (future)
   - `is_hidden` flag on pages
   - Editors can hide/show pages
   - Hidden pages not visible to Viewers

3. **Audit Logging** (future)
   - Track who deleted what comment
   - Track role changes
   - Track user blocks

4. **Email Notifications** (future)
   - Notify users when blocked
   - Notify users when roles changed

## ‚ú® Benefits

- **Granular Control**: Different permissions for different users
- **Security**: Role-based access prevents unauthorized actions
- **Audit Trail**: Soft deletes preserve history
- **Flexibility**: Multiple roles per user
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new roles/permissions

The role system is fully implemented in the backend and ready for frontend admin panel development!
